# FruitVision
FruitVision is a machine learning project built using Jupyter Notebook to identify and classify different types of fruits. This tool leverages advanced algorithms to provide accurate fruit recognition from images, making it ideal for educational purposes, research, or simply exploring various fruits.

# Features
1.Image-Based Recognition: Identify fruits from uploaded images.
2.Real-Time Classification: Get instant results with high accuracy.
3.Detailed Information: Provides additional details about recognized fruits.

# Requirements
1.Python 3.x
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.Required Python libraries (TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy,Matplotlib,Pandas)

# Installation
     1.clone the Repository:
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fruitvision.git
     2.Navigate to the project directory:
        cd Fruitvision
     3.Install the required libraries
        pip install pandas matplotlib tensorflow numpy;
# Usage
      1.Launch Jupyter Notebook
         command-jupyter notebook
      2.Open the image_classification_model.ipynb file.
      3.Follow the instructions in the notebook to upload images and receive fruit classification results.

# How It Works
The project utilizes machine learning models to process and recognize fruit images. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how the model is trained, validated, and tested. It also includes code snippets for image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
